# Pymaceuticals Study (Module 5 Challenge)

## Overview
This project uses Matplotlib and Pandas to explore the results of a preclinical mouse trial studying squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Pymaceuticals, a pharmaceutical company, aims to evaluate the effectiveness of its drug candidate, **Capomulin**, compared to other treatment regimens.

## Dataset
- 249 mice diagnosed with SCC tumors
- Tracked over a 45-day treatment period
- Multiple drug regimens, including Capomulin

## Objectives
- Assess Capomulinâ€™s performance vs. other drugs
- Visualize tumor response trends
- Analyze correlations between tumor size and mouse weight

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Steps

### Data Exploration
- Load and clean the dataset
- Identify and remove duplicate or missing data
- Summarize key mouse and tumor characteristics

### Visualizations
- Tumor volume over time by drug regimen
- Individual tumor responses to Capomulin
- Bar charts, line graphs, boxplots, and scatter plots
- Correlation and linear regression analysis (e.g., weight vs. tumor size)

## Key Findings
- Capomulin consistently reduced tumor size over time
- Positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume
- Capomulin performed favorably compared to other drugs

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided.
3. Execute cells to load data and generate analysis visualizations.
